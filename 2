# State of Health Estimation of LMO/NMC-based Electric Vehicle Lithium-Ion Batteries Using the Incremental Capacity Analysis Technique

**Accurate** & **low computational demanding**
**state-of-health (SOH) estimation algorithm**
**battery management systems in electric vehicle (EV)**
**incremental capacity analysis (ICA) technique** _for estimating_ 
    - the capacity fade
    - the SOH 
of **LMO/NMC-based EV** _Lithium-ion batteries_.
Based on **ageing results** collected during **eleven months of testing**,
we were able to **accurately relate** the **capacity fade** of the studied batteries to the evolution of the voltage value,
which corresponds to one of the incremental capacity
(IC) valleys, obtained using the ICA technique.

# Incremental Capacity Analysis as a State of Health Estimation Method for Lithium-Ion Battery Modules with Series-Connected Cells

TODO, TBH, nothing new seems to emerge out of this article, so, move on

# Computer modelling of electricl power systems

Electrical power systems

What the hell is a **steady and dynamic** state of electrical power systems?

Prereqs

- power system theory
- matrix analysis
- neumerical techniques

computational and transmission system developments
**FACTS** & **HVDC** links
General purpose single phase load flow program

Neuton fast decoupled algorithm
power system in dynamic states
electronagmetic transients with reference to the EMPT method
power electronic components
electromechanical models

## Chapter-1(Introduction)

**FORTRAN** based power system computer progarams implemented to run on mainframes

**HVDC && FACTS technologies**
_modern power transmission and distribution systems are A.C. right?_

EMTP -> Electro Magnetic Transient Programs
RTDS -> Real Time Digital Simulation

- **HIGH VOLTAGE DIRECT CURRENT** => HVDC
- **FLEXIBLE ALTERNATING CURRENT TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS** => FACTS

Okay, I'm looking to gain understanding on Battery Management Systems
Current book that I'm reading is **Computer Modelling of Electrical Power Systems**
You have to stop reading this book because

1. It doesn't have any thing on BMS
2. It contains topics on **Load Flow** and **Transmission Systems Modelling**
3. It contains topics like **FACTS** & **HVDC** transmission, which, Right now, I don't give a flying fuck.

# Questions

- what are computationally economical methods for determining SoH of a BMS which are Accurate as well?

- What are the most common methods used for determining SoH of a BMS?

- How can we use such methods to determing SoH of a BMS for a real world EV?

- Okay, ICA(Incremental Capacity Analysis) is a method for determining SoH, which is, both, computationally economical as well as pretty much accurate?

- ICA can further be used for **Capacity Fade**?

- What the hell is capacity fade anyway?
